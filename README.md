# SpaceRivals [abandoned long time ago]
OpenGL demo game created in the image of the AirRivals game. 

Game preview:

# Info about assets
A spaceship is a test asset scraped from the AirRivals game and processed to .obj -> .fof format. Asteroids are free assets from the internet (I can not find the link anymore). The rest is made by me.

# Support 
The project is quite old and therefore abandoned (I am ashamed to look at this code after years), but the binary works. Tested on Intel and nVidia cards.

# SpaceRivals [abandoned long time ago]
OpenGL demo game created in the image of the AirRivals game. 

Game preview:

# Info about assets
A spaceship and rockets are a test assets scraped from the AirRivals game and processed to .obj -> .fof format. Asteroids are free assets from the internet (I can not find the link anymore). 2D explosion animations also come from the internet and were free. The rest is made by me.

# Support 
The project is quite old and therefore abandoned (I am ashamed to look at this code after years), but the binary works. Tested on Intel and nVidia cards.
